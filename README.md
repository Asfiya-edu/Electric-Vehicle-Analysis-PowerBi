# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard - PowerBI

## Project Overview: Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard

### Introduction
Electric Vehicles (EVs) are revolutionizing the automotive industry by using one or more electric motors for propulsion. These vehicles can be powered by external electricity sources or autonomously by batteries, which can be charged through various means, including solar panels and fuel cells. EVs encompass a wide range of transportation modes, including road and rail vehicles, surface and underwater vessels, electric aircraft, and spacecraft. For road vehicles, EVs are a crucial component of the Connected, Autonomous, Shared, and Electric (CASE) Mobility vision, which represents the future of transportation.
